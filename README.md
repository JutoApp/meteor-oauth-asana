# juto:oauth-asana

An ES2015 Meteor OAuth handler package for Asana. Based on the work by Rob Fallows' on his [imgur example](https://github.com/robfallows/tunguska-imgur) (and [accounts-imgur](https://github.com/robfallows/tunguska-accounts-imgur)).

This is a fully working OAuth handler, allowing you to use Asana as your Meteor authentication method. If you want to use it "as is" you can just `meteor add juto:oauth-asana` to your application.

See also the [complementary login package](https://github.com/jutoapp/meteor-accounts-asana): `juto:accounts-asana`.

Enjoy :smile:
